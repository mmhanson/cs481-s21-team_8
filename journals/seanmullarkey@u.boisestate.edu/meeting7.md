# Meeting 7

- Attendance: Everyone present

We started our planning lab this week. We divided up our user stories into 3 big features we wanted to implement into our application. I decided to tackle everything to do with the spotify API and how that integrates with discord.

While we were deciding on our user stories, I went ahead and showed the team the new CI system that has been implemented into github and how it interacts with our discod bot when it runs the tests on CI. 

Forrest showed us how the discord bot is now being hosted on heroku and showed us how the interactions come from a web server rather than a local machine which was very cool!

My task for this week:
- Look into access tokens for the Spotify API
- Look into testing the endpoints using fixtures
