# Meeting 8

- Attendance: Everyone present

We started the meeting with everyone showing the new implementations of tasks that they defined for each other for this week. Forrest showed us the new Heroku deployment and how it will be integrated with github to auto deploy anything on the master branch. Ben showed us the Audio DB interaction through discord and I showed the spotify API interaction through the same interface. We then spent the last little bit of time combing what we have worked on onto one branch and committing that to development

My task for this week:
- Fix output and how it is styled on discord
- Research if an endpoint exists where we can specify a song and a track from the spotify API
