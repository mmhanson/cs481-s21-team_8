# Meeting 3

- Attendance: Everyone present

We started working on our tech lab this week. We started the meeting out by 
discussing possible frameworks to use for our discord bot. We came across a few
different options such as discord-hero and discord-akairo. We also found a few 
articles and video tutorials on how to create a simple discord bot. Using 
this, we developed a simple hello world application using python3 after 
installing the necessary packages. In order for this to work, we simply used 
the discord.py framework.

We started a new channel on our existing server as a testing site for our bot 
and successfully managed to make it respond with a connection from our app.


My task for this week:
- Write up the report for which framework/languages we would like to use for our application
- Start forming a plan on how we will like to integrate some form of build for our application
