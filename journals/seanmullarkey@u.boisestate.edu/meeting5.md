# Meeting 5

- Attendance: Everyone present

I built a test script this week using the distest framework. This framework creates a new bot to interact with our current discord bot and runs through the commands defined by the regular bot's functionality. There were a few prerequesites we needed to cover as a team to get the testing environment fully set up. So the first half of the meeting, I shared my screen so that Ben and Forrest could follow along to get their scripts working properly.

After this Forrest showed us how the docker script, which is an important part of our build process works. He showed us how to start docker and to specifically start and shell into our bot container.

My task for this week:
- Build out new tests for our bot.
- Start thinking about what kind of functionality our bot will be able to provide
- Start designing test patterns for our functionality
