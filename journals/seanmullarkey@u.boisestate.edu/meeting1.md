# Meeting 1

- Attendance: Everyone present

We initially came up with a few ideas last Thursday (1/14/21) when we initially met in groups. We shrunk our potential project to 3 ideas. 

The first idea we came up with was using a location or a map api to find 
the best or unpopular hiking trails in the city of Idaho. We found that 
the city of Idaho has it's own api that does list popular trails in the 
foothills and we considered using that.

The second idea we came up with was to create an app that shows 
availability in parking garages in the Boise area. Our idea was to 
implement a web scraper that goes onto the parkboi website to check 
the availability of parking garages. Due to requiring a ticket to enter, 
which the garage database keeps track of, we thought it might be a more 
reliable app to build compared to a Boise State University parking
availability tracker due to that info being less reliable. 

The third and final idea that we are ultimately leaning towards is a 
discord bot that streams spotify songs based on user request. We will 
connect this bot to a separate api other than the spotify one. 
TheAudioDB endpoint allows us to get the music video view count as well 
as the like/dislike ratio on the given track's music video. Using this 
the bot will rank the members of the chat by musical taste. The more 
dislike average from the overall songs a user requests, the worse his 
taste will be.


My task for this week:
- Research how to create a discord bot
- Research how to set up dev environment and api authorization for spotify and TheAudioDB
