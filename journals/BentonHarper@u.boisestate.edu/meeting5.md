# Meeting 5

- Attendance: All were present

This week we spent our time talking about how to test our bot. Between meetings Sean got a second bot up and running 
that communicates with our main bot to run different tests we can write. He showed us what to download and the code
he had to change for it to work, and my and Forrest both got it up and running so any of us can run the tests. Forrest
had also gotten Docker working since he works with containers frequently, so he gave me and Sean a little lesson of the
basics and demonstrated a few things.

My task for this week:

- Come up with more tests for our test bot
- Keep researching how to write a discord bot
