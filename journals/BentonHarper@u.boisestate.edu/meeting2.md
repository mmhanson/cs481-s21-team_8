# Meeting 2

- Attendance: All present

This week's meeting was well focused. We decided on what features we wanted to include in our Discord bot,
then we made a Google Doc to all work on to write our epic. In our epic we discussed the two main features
of our bot, to play music and analyze the music tastes of the users, then gave more detail as to how we're
going to implement those features. We also added a section at the bottom with some ideas that we'll consider
adding at the end after our bot is fully functional, but it's nothing that's set in stone. Before turning it 
in we also all agreed to look it back over in a couple of days to ensure we all agree with it still.

We were all engaged in the discussion during the meeting when discussing the specifics of our features, such
as what order we will search for the songs vs store the song data in, if we'll access Spotify or the AudioDB
first, and the formats for displaying song information as well as the "music taste" rankings. We decided it
would be best to access Spotify first, since we assume that all songs on Spotify will be in the AudioDB, and
we tentatively agreed that we would store something like 50 songs that we can display the info for. For the
music taste rankings we decided just to print it out line by line, a sumple 1st to nth ranking, with funny
harmless messages about each person's score. Overall, a very productive meeting.

My task for this week:

- Research how Discord bots work
- Better understand the AudioDB
- Start thinking of possible user stories
