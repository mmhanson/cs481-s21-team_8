# Meeting 7

- Attendance: All were present

This week we all started work on our own tasks. During our actual meeting we all caught up with each other about what we've done.
I showed them how I successfully was getting information from the audiodb, and how the commands worked with the spotify bot.
Sean also showed us how he got the spotify api working, and Forrest gave us updates on the heroku situation. Me and Sean spent
the last part of the meeting combining our code to get a basic version of our bot running.

My task for this week:

- Create more commands for the audiodb functionality
- Work on layout for our outputs
- Get the teasing messages working
