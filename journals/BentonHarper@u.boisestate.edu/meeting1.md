# Meeting 1

- Attendance: All present

This week we discussed further ideas for our project. We already had the idea of some sort of discord bot interacting
with Spotify and possibly YouTube, but for a while we explored different ideas. We talked about using some sort of map 
API for an app, such as for a trail finder or a parking spot near you type of thing, but decided it wouldn't work as 
well as our other idea, so we went back to talking about making a bot. We discussed how it would basically work, finding 
the song thorugh YouTube then adding it to a Spotify playlist, but eventually we scrapped the idea of using YouTube at 
all and decided to just use Spotify directly. We did realize that our idea wasn't as original, so for a little but we 
talked about some sort of movie/tv fact checker using IMDb, but ultimately decided the app would be too simple. We then 
sort of combined parts of the idea and thought it would be cool to be able to ask for facts about the current song, 
which lead us to find a database that has tons of different information that we can use to make multiple different 
features to our bot.

My task for this week:

- Research how to make Discord bots
- Brainstorm ideas for other cool features that could be added to the bot
- Better understand the functions of the audiodb
