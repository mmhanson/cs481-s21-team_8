# Meeting 3

- Attendance: All present

This week in our group we start by all watching a simple Discord bot tutorial video, basically to get our "Hello World"
working for this weeks task. After we all watched it, Sean went back and watched it again, following along, and after some
trial and error with our bot's token resetting when he pushed the code to github, we had our "Hello World" functional.

While Sean was doing that, me and Forrest were looking for any possible frameworks we could use. We both found one
that we could possibly use, which we then researched more in order to write about them in the README. The one i researched
was called discord-hero, and while it had some nice features, for what we need to do, it'd be more beneficial to stick
to the normal discord.py we found, especially since we're all inexperienced with Discord for the most part.

My task for this week:

- Start doing more research into discord.py
- Make sure I can run the "Hello World" from my machine as well
- Look into the Spotify API, and how it can work with discord bots
