# Meeting 3

- Attendance: All members were in attendance

During today's meeting we took care of the tech lab. We started off by watching a short tutorial on how to create a basic "hello world" Discord bot that could send simple messages to our team Discord. Sean wrote up the code from the tutorial and after some tests, got it to work perfectly by sending messages to a seperate channel we created for bot testing. This was awesome to see and was really a cool first step to the project. After this, we focused in on the README part of the lab, deciding to write about three different Discord frameworks (which Ben and I had been researching) - Akario, discord-hero, and Discord.py.

We also met back the following day on Friday to finalize a few things on the README and get that uploaded.

My tasks for this week:

- Run the Discord bot to make sure it works correctly on my machine
- Continue to research Discord.py so I have a better understanding of how all the components fit together
- Start to think about what a build system for the project would look like
