# Meeting 4

- Attendance: All in attendance

This meeting was very productive. Sean had got a framework for testing our Discord bot called distest up and running in the days prior, so we had seen messages from the testing bot coming through our test chat. We took the first part of the meeting for Sean to walk Ben and I through how the testing system was implemented and set up so we could run it on our own machines. I had got the Docker container our bot will be run out of up and running, so when Sean was done I went through and explained the Docker container, how it's built, run, defined, etc. We closed by disucssing Docker and Heroku's interplay as we intend to host our bot in Heroku.

My tasks for the coming week:

- Get a Heroku repo set up with Docker for the bot to run out of so we can start making sure this system works
