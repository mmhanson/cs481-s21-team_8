# Meeting 5

- Attendance: All in attendance

This meeting was spent setting up the CI lab. I spent much of it working on continuing to get Heroku and Docker up and running correctly with the bot, which has proven difficult and has posed a lot of challenges. We got Github actions partly up and running but are running into issues surounding the fact that tokens uploaded to Github in our .env file are automatically invalidated.

My task for the coming week:

- Continue to work on getting an instance of the bot up and running on Heroku so that we can make sure that works
