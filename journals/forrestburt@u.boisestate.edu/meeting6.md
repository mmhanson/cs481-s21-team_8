# Meeting 6

- Attendance: All in attendance

This meeting was spent getting the planning lab done. We had a major success with the bot and Heroku in that I was finally able to get the bot to come on and offline in a way that certifies it's linked to the dyno running it on Heroku. I'm thrilled to be able to finally ping test messages back and forth with it - it's been a lot of time to get it up and running on there successfully. We discussed how to generally divide work for the project up, and I will be managing DevOps sort of stuff related to Heroku/Docker/environments like that. We identified needs for ways to interact with the Heroku/Docker instances, which became my tasks in the planning lab.

My task for the coming week:

- Get my part of the planning lab done and start work on the tasks there
