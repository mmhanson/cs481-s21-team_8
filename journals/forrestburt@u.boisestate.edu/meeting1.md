# Meeting 1

- Attendance: All members in attendance.

All members were present. Our discussion was generally focused around what kinds of APIs we were interested in exploring for the project, as well as where exactly we could implement these APIs. At our last meeting, we threw some ideas around about making some kind of Discord bot that implements the Spotify API to allow a user to automatically save songs to their own Spotify library directly from Discord chat. This week we discussed a number of ways that we could expand upon that idea, including implementing a function to automatically generate a Discord server playlist from all music linked or mentioned in the chat. We also discussed how this could use the YouTube API to generate playlists there for use or export to Spotify. We talked about maybe implementing a similar function for movies using the IMDB API, but this seemed after some discussion to be a little basic and like something that had been done before.

In addition to the Spotify API, we discussed the possiblity of building something more local. We found that the City of Boise has an API that can be accessed to get all kinds of information about the Ridge to Rivers trail system in the foothills, so we discussed finding a way to use this API in an app to automatically provide trail information. We also discussed maybe finding a way to get information about parking spots available in garages downtown or general parking garage availability, so this is also an option.

We finished by returning to the Discord bot idea but as more of a taste analyzer than an automatic Spotify interface. We've found that you can get data about the like/dislike ratios of music videos from a site called TheAudioDB, so we're considering building a bot that when called will gather all the songs mentioned or linked in a Discord chat and give out ratings on the taste of the chat and the individual users.

My task for this week:

- Research Discord bots, TheAudioDB, and related technologies that seem like they'll be necessary for the taste analyzer project
