# Meeting 8

- Attendance: All were present

We met on Tuesday of this week as I was going to be out for work training on Thursday and because there was much to share. Ben went over his new integrations with TheAudioDB, and demoed functions related to the rating of user's taste based on songs. This is all printed into neat, nice looking UI boxes in Discord that stand out and make it obvious what's going on. the album cover is even included which makes it look even better. Sean showed us new ways of searching Spotify that he figured out that allow us to be more specific in our searches. 

I created a new guide to getting a local Docker container with the bot inside of it set up for testing. I also uploaded the finalized version of the Dockerfile I've been working on that allows the project to be automatically built with Heroku. We have also tested the Github/Heroku integration and it seems to work well, but a little more testing is still required.

My task for this week:

- Continue to work through the tasks list in the planning lab
